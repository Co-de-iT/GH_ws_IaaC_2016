### agent-based design at the urban scale

##### _where_ | IaaC, Barcelona
##### _when_ | April 15th-17th, 2016
##### _tutors_ | Aldo Sollazzo, Alessio Erioli

## . brief

While urban structures act like ecologies, developing interdependent relations across diverse scales; all too often the design tools applied at the urban scale (ie planning) limit themselves to a series of top-down decisions, with a single decisional direction spanning concentric scales.
The aim of the workshop is to explore a shift in the design paradigm, from the planning of urban criteria and parameters, to the design of behaviors able to operate in information rich environments, finally allowing to build urban structures from the bottom up.
Starting from pervasive data maps, the operational substrate, participants will design basic behaviors for a multi-agent based system able to grow building coherent compounds, which are not only responsive geometries, but are constantly assessed by an internal feedback system.
The general aim is to design an ecology of mutual negotiation strategies between agents and the environment, thus re-thinking the hierarchies at work on the urban scale. In this sense scale itself is not just understood as extensive metric size, but rather the detection of certain system behaviors.
Using detail as the form of procedural information [1], the workshop outcome will span several scales, the definition of the system detail being decisive and propagative in its influence on the systemâ€™s growth, shape and performance.

## . workshop material

### code

The workshop code is organized in topic-based folders. The current code (and the info in this file) will be updated and integrated as the workshop unfolds.

##### WIP
WIP folder - tentative code and stuff goes here


### references

Some bits and hints of reading for both a theoretical and practical contextualization of the computational strategies developed.
