In this sense scale itself is not just understood as extensive metric size, but rather the detection of certain system behaviors.\r\nUsing detail as the form of procedural information [1], the workshop outcome will span several scales, the definition of the system detail being decisive and propagative in its influence on the systemâ€™s growth, shape and performance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## . agenda\r\n\r\n### day 01\r\n##### _afternoon_\r\n\r\n+ introduction to agency (lecture)\r\n+ first approach to behavior-based protocols in Grasshopper\r\n+ environmental data implementation\r\n+ flocking and stigmergy 1/2\r\n+ flocking and stigmergy 2/2\r\n\r\n### day 02\r\n\r\n##### _morning_\r\n\r\n+ generation process\r\n+ generative urban morphologies\r\n+ generative urban patterns\r\n+ generative urban apparatus \r\n\r\n##### _afternoon_\r\n\r\n+ tutorized work + personal development\r\n\r\n### day 03\r\n\r\n##### _morning_\r\n\r\n+ tutorized work + personal development\r\n\r\n##### _afternoon_\r\n\r\n+ tutorized work + personal development\r\n+ presentation \r\n+ final party \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## . requirements\r\n\r\nAll participants should be equipped with their own laptop and, besides the latest version of Rhinoceros 3D and Grasshopper (Windows only), be sure to have also installed the latest version of the following plugins:\r\n\r\n+ [4D Noise](http://www.food4rhino.com/project/4dnoise)\r\n+ [Anemone](http://www.food4rhino.com/project/anemone)\r\n+ [Boids](http://www.food4rhino.com/project/boid)\r\n+ [Cocoon](http://www.bespokegeometry.com/2015/07/22/cocoon/)\r\n+ [Heteroptera](http://www.food4rhino.com/project/heteroptera)\r\n+ [Human](http://www.food4rhino.com/project/human)\r\n+ [Human UI](http://www.food4rhino.com/project/human-ui)\r\n+ [LadyBug + HoneyBee](http://www.food4rhino.com/project/ladybug-honeybee)\r\n+ [Mesh Tools](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/mesh-pipe)\r\n+ [Sandbox Topology](http://www.food4rhino.com/project/sandboxtopo)\r\n+ [Shortest Walk](http://www.food4rhino.com/project/shortestwalkgh)\r\n\r\n(suggestions: Tree8, LunchBox - I'll also share a bunch of user objects I have)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## . workshop material\r\n\r\n### code\r\n\r\nThe workshop code is organized in topic-based folders.
